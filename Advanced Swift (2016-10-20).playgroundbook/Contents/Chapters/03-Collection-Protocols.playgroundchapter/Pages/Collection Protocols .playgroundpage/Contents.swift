# Collection Protocols 

We saw in the previous chapter that `Array`, `Dictionary`, and `Set` don't exist
in a vacuum. They're all implemented on top of a rich set of abstractions for
processing series of elements, provided by the Swift standard library. This
chapter is all about the `Sequence` and `Collection` protocols, which form the
cornerstones of this model. We'll cover how these protocols work, why they work
they way they do, and how you can write your own sequences and collections.

## Who Is This Book For?

This book targets experienced (though not necessarily expert) programmers — such
as existing Apple-platform developers, or those coming from other languages such
as Java or C++ — who want to bring their knowledge of Swift to the same level as
that of Objective-C or some other language. It's also suitable for new
programmers who started on Swift, have grown familiar with the basics, and are
looking to take things to the next level.

It's not meant as an introduction to Swift; it assumes you're familiar with the
syntax and structure of the language. If you want some good, compact coverage of
the basics of Swift, the best source is the official Apple Swift book (available
on
[iBooks](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/swift-programming-language/id1002622538)
or on [Apple's website](https://developer.apple.com/swift/resources/)). If
you're already a confident programmer, you could try reading both our book and
the Apple Swift book in parallel.

This is also not a book about programming for OS X or iOS devices. Of course,
since Swift is currently mainly used on Apple platforms, we've tried to include
examples of practical use, but we hope this book will be useful for
non-Apple-platform programmers as well.

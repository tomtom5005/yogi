#### Reduce

Both `map` and `filter` take an array and produce a new, modified array.
Sometimes, however, you want to combine all elements into a new value. For
example, to sum up all the elements, we could write the following code:

*/

//#-hidden-code
let fibs = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5]
//#-end-hidden-code

//#-editable-code
var total = 0
for num in fibs {
    total = total + num
}
total
//#-end-editable-code

/*:
The `reduce` method takes this pattern and abstracts two parts: the initial
value (in this case, zero), and the function for combining the intermediate
value (`total`) and the element (`num`). Using reduce, we can write the same
example like this:

*/

//#-editable-code
let sum = fibs.reduce(0) { total, num in total + num }
//#-end-editable-code

/*:
Operators are functions too, so we could've also written the same example like
this:

*/

//#-editable-code
fibs.reduce(0, +)
//#-end-editable-code

/*:
The output type of reduce doesn't have to be the same as the element type. For
example, if we want to convert a list of integers into a string, with each
number followed by a space, we can do the following:

*/

//#-editable-code
fibs.reduce("") { str, num in str + "\(num) " }
//#-end-editable-code

/*:
Here's the implementation for `reduce`:

*/

//#-editable-code
extension Array {
    func reduce_sample_impl<Result>(_ initialResult: Result, 
        _ nextPartialResult: (Result, Element) -> Result) -> Result 
    {
        var result = initialResult
        for x in self {
            result = nextPartialResult(result, x)
        }
        return result
    }
}
//#-end-editable-code

/*:
Another performance tip: `reduce` is very flexible, and it's common to see it
used to build arrays and perform other operations. For example, you can
implement `map` and `filter` using only `reduce`:

*/

//#-editable-code
extension Array {
    func map_sample_impl2<T>(_ transform: (Element) -> T) -> [T] {
        return reduce([]) {
            $0 + [transform($1)]
        }
    }

    func filter_sample_impl2(_ isIncluded: (Element) -> Bool) -> [Element] {
        return reduce([]) {
            isIncluded($1) ? $0 + [$1] : $0
        }
    }
}
//#-end-editable-code

/*:
This is kind of beautiful and has the benefit of not needing those icky
imperative `for` loops. But Swift isn't Haskell, and Swift arrays aren't lists.
What's happening here is that every time, through the combine function, a brand
new array is being created by appending the transformed or included element to
the previous one. This means that both these implementations are `O(n^2)`, not
`O(n)` â€” as the length of the array increases, the time these functions take
increases quadratically.

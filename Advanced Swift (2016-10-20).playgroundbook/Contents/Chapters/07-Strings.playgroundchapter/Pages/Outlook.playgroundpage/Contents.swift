## Outlook

When Chris Lattner outlined [the goals for
Swift 4](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160725/025676.html)
in July 2016, improvements to string handling were among the handful of primary
objectives:

> `String` is one of the most important fundamental types in the language. The
> standard library leads have numerous ideas of how to improve the programming
> model for it, without jeopardizing the goals of providing a
> unicode-correct-by-default model. Our goal is to be better at string
> processing than Perl\!

The Swift team has also expressed on numerous occasions its desire to provide
native language support for regular expressions, though it remains to be seen if
there's time for such an additive feature in the Swift 4 timeframe. Whatever the
case may be, expect string handling to change in the future.
